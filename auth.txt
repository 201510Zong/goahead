#       role name=NAME abilities=ABILITIES
#
#   Routes may require authentication and that users possess certain abilities.
#   The abilities, extensions, methods and redirect keywords use comma separated tokens to express a set of 
#       required options, or use "|" separated tokens for a set of alternative options. This implements AND/OR.
#
#   Examples:
#
#   Define roles
#       role name=manager abilities=view,edit,delete
#
#   Define a user
#       user name=joshua password=2fd6e47ff9bb70c0465fd2f5c8e5305e roles=manager,purchaser
