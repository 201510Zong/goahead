DESCRIPTION
       GoAhead  is  a  compact  embedded HTTP web server.  It is a fast, small-
       footprint, multi-threaded, standards-based, portable  server  developed
       for  use  by embedded devices and applications.  It can run as a stand-
       alone web server or the GoAhead library can be embedded in applications.

       GoAhead supports HTTP/1.1, SSL, digest and basic authentication, virtual
       hosting, ranged requests, chunked transfers, file upload  and  security
       limits.  GoAhead has an Apache style configuration file and supports the
       PHP and Ejscript web frameworks.

       GoAhead normally reads the goahead.conf  file  for  configuration  direc-
       tives.  However, if goahead is invoked with an IP address or port number
       on the command line, GoAhead  will  not  read  the  configuration  file.
       Rather it will listen for requests on the specified IP:PORT address. If
       the PORT component is omitted, GoAhead will listen on port 80. If the IP
       address  is  omitted  and a port is supplied, GoAhead will listen on all
       network interfaces.

OPTIONS
       --config filename
              Define the name of the GoAhead configuration  file.  This  is  by
              default goahead.

       --chroot directory
              Change  the  system  root  directory  for GoAhead. This creates a
              chroot jail so that the GoAhead process cannot access  any  files
              outside the given directory.

       --debugger
              Run GoAhead in debug mode and disable all timeouts. This disables
              request and session timeouts.  The -d option  is  an  alias  for
              --debug.

       --exe path
              Set  the  path  to  the goahead.exe executable image. This may be
              required on VxWorks so that GoAhead can load  modules  which  are
              located   at  "goahead.exe/../lib".  This  is  necessary  because
              VxWorks cannot determine the path to  the  executable  image  at
              runtime.

       --log logSpec
              Name the GoAhead log file. This will override the ErrorLog direc-
              tive in the  configuration  file.   When  the  maximum  size  is
              exceeded,  the log file will be rotated to logName.old and a new
              log file will be started. The -l option is an alias  for  --log.
              The syntax is:

              --log logName[:logLevel][.maxSize]

       --home directory
              Define the server home directory for GoAhead.

       --threads numThreads
              Specify  the  maximum  number  of  threads to use for the goahead
              thread pool. This overrides the ThreadLimit  configuration  file
              directive.

       --verbose
              Shorthand  for  --log  stdout:4.  The  -v option is an alias for
              --verbose.

       --version
              Output the product version number.
